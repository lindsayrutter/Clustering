- 6 different wasps?\

\
- Normalize all 30 samples\
	- Might have to remove junk samples at this point\
- Side by side boxplots of the raw 30 samples (see how much normalization needs to be done)\
- Side by size boxplots manually (to save time, possibly)\
	- 
\b tidyR
\b0  (make 2 columns of sample label and count)\
		- plot sample on horizontal axis and count on vertical\
		- gather() function in tidyR\
\
1) Make boxplot of raw 30 samples (use log scale because each samples has a very different maximum read count) (F2 has very large value, NU.3 does not have any large values)\
- ggparcoord(countTableWasp, columns=1:ncol(countTableWasp), alphaLines=0, boxplot=TRUE, scale="globalminmax") + coord_flip() + scale_y_log10()\
- NU.3 may be problematic, rest should be okay with a bit of normalization\
\
-betweenLaneNormalization\
	-all other norm methods stretch 5 num summaries to be the same across samples\
	- but bLN makes the distributions for all samples the same\
\
- check that it looks reasonable, and reps look more similar than treatments (with scatmat). do them pairwise.\
- if looks strange, drop samples, and renormalize\
\
\
- interaction plots for the top genes of the lists\
\
\
- make replication plot for top 1000 genes\
blue = unrestricted\
red = restricted\
-1 = drumming\
+1 = not drumming\
\
fit 2 factor model with interaction (look at protocol paper to work out how to do that). used normalized data.\
check dispersion (edgeR paper has suggestions on checking dispersion)\
\
\
\
1) For soybean final report, we did normalization and removal of quartiles for just the 6 leaves\
2) scatmat and boxplot in final report are just on cpm.y.new\
	- ggparcoord(data.frame(cpm.y.new), columns=1:17, alphaLines=0, boxplot=TRUE, scale="globalminmax") + coord_flip()\
	- scatmat(data.frame(cpm.y.new)[,c(9,13,14,12,16,17)])\
	- all that was done beforehand was\
		- cpm.y.new(TRUE, TRUE)\
		- remove half of samples\
		- calcNormFactors\
		- cpm.y.new <- cpm(y, TRUE, TRUE)\
		- mds <- plotMDS(cpm.y.new)\
		- scatmat(data.frame(cpm.y.new)[,c(9,13,14,12,16,17)])\
		- ggparcoord(data.frame(cpm.y.new), columns=1:17, alphaLines=0, boxplot=TRUE, scale="globalminmax") + coord_flip()\
\
- remove lowest repetition count after do cpm()\
- scale or not scale?\
- edgeR not eliminate so many low mean and low stdev?\
